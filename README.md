## **The Monkees**

This website was created for my end of module project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end website showcasing the skills I have learnt so far in HTML and CSS.
The website is a fan page for the popular 1960’s band The Monkees. The website had to showcase the bands music/images/videos as well as make users aware and give them the option to book them for a special event. As well as this, the website would be used to attract new fans to the band.

#### **UX**

After interviewing a few potential users, I was able to gain the following user stories:
* As a fan of the band, I want to be able to learn more about the band’s members as I am interested in their back story, as well as find their social media pages.
* As a fan of the band, to would like to be able to listen to my favourite Monkees songs without having to download them and find the rest of their music on Spotify, Itunes etc.
* As an event organiser, I would like to find out pricing/availability for the band so that I may book them for private events

To plan out how my wesbite would look on both desktop/tablet screens and mobiles I hand drew wireframes for each of these for each section of my website.

#### **Features**

###### **Existing Features**

My website is a single scrolling page with four seperate sections. On the left hand corner there is a Monkees logo which stays fixed in this position throughout every section, which takes you back to the homepage when you click it. My homepage is simple and has a large image of the band which stays fixed in its position when you scroll. The various clickable links to the other sections of the website are also located on the homepage. It is possible to also simply scroll down through the various sections using your finger/mouse but these provide a quicker way to get to each section if the user knows which part they would like to see. On mobile devices this top nav bar collapes into a drop down menu on the right hand side which then shows the various section links when you touch on it.

The about section features portrait images of the four different band members and a bit of background on each of them.

The music section showcases three of The Monkees' most popular songs as well as a music video of theirs to showcase their talent. The background to this section is another large image of the band that stays fixed in its position when you scroll.

The events section allows you to fill in a form to enquire about pricing/availability to book the band for a private event. By detailing your name, email address and event description/date after which a memeber of the team gets back to you. The form will not let you submit it unless you have filled in all three boxes and the email address format is correct.

The footer section includes links to their social media pages as well as Itunes, Spotify and YouTube to discover more of the bands music.

###### **Features Left to Implement**

* An image gallery/carosoul featuring images of the band
* A fixed navbar thoughout all the sections
* Concert dates
* More complex contact form

#### **Technologies Used**

* HTML5 - website content
* CSS3 - Styling and making the website look professional
* Bootstrap - 
* Blisk - to test responsiveness on various screens

#### **Testing**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form:
i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

#### **Deployment**

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
•	Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
•	Different configuration files?
•	Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
